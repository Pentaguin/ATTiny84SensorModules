# ATTiny84SensorModules
 ATTiny84 microcontroller that can send the status from the PIR and the Reed sensor over Bluetooth Low Energy to another device that can receive BLE. For example ESP32.
 It consists of an ATTiny84, jdy-10 BLE module, Reed sensor and PIR sensor.
 It runs in power down mode to conserve energy comsuption and use Pin Change Interrupt to detect the sensor changes.
 
 It is written using Platform IO in visual studio code.
